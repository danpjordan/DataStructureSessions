1.	Suppose a dynamic integer array a with indices beginning at 0 has 1000 elements and the line of code a[1000] = a[5] is executed . 
How many array values must be moved from one memory location to another to complete this assignment statement?

2. Is the formula for finding the location of an element in a dynamic array different 
from the formula for finding the location of an element in a static array?

3. Memory could be freed when a dynamic array shrinks. What advantages or disadvantages might this have?

4.	When a dynamic array expands, why canâ€™t the existing elements be 
left in place and extra memory simply be allocated at the end of the existing memory allocation?
