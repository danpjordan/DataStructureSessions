# DataStructureSessions
Lesson plans I created for teaching Data Structures COP 4530.
This is my collection of suplimental material which I created during recitation sessions.

Do note, this material goes along side an explanation I presented of the topic and will not be fully sufficient to learn from.

Some of the data structure class definitions were sourced under Fair Use (Section 107 of the U.S. Code) from:
Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and David M. Mount
